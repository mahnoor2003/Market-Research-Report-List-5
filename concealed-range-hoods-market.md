<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concealed Range Hoods Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Flow</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concealed range hoods come in two main types - Axial Flow and Centrifugal. Axial Flow range hoods are typically more compact and efficient, as they use a fan that pulls air directly through the hood and exhausts it outside. On the other hand, Centrifugal range hoods use a fan that draws air into the hood, where it is then forced through a series of filters before being exhausted outside. While Axial Flow hoods are better suited for smaller spaces, Centrifugal hoods are generally more powerful and effective for larger kitchens.</p></p>
