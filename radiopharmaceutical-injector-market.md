<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiopharmaceutical Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic Injector</li><li>Manual Injector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiopharmaceutical injectors are devices used in nuclear medicine to administer radiopharmaceuticals into a patient's body for imaging or therapy purposes. There are two main types of injectors: Automatic injectors, which are computer-controlled devices that precisely regulate the administration of the radiopharmaceutical, and Manual injectors, where the injection process is controlled by the operator. Automatic injectors offer more consistent and accurate dosing, while manual injectors require more hands-on control from the operator. Both types play a crucial role in the radiopharmaceutical market for efficient and safe administration of radiopharmaceuticals.</p></p>
