<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Water Mist Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Nozzles</li><li>Closed Nozzles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Pressure Water Mist Systems are categorized into Open Nozzles and Closed Nozzles markets. In the Open Nozzles market, water mist is discharged through a series of nozzles that are open at all times, providing continuous coverage of the protected area. On the other hand, the Closed Nozzles market involves the use of nozzles that are normally closed but open when a fire is detected, releasing a high-pressure water mist to suppress the flames. Both systems are effective in extinguishing fires and protecting assets.</p></p>
