<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embedded Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact temperature sensors are designed to measure temperature without physically touching the object being measured. These sensors use technologies like infrared radiation or thermal imaging to detect temperature from a distance. They are commonly used in industrial and medical applications where contact could introduce error or pose a safety risk. Contact temperature sensors, on the other hand, require direct physical contact with the object to measure its temperature accurately. They are often used in consumer electronics and automotive industries where precise temperature measurement is critical.</p></p>
