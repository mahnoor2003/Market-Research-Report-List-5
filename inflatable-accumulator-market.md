<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inflatable Accumulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>Spring-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inflatable accumulators can be classified into two main types: gravity-type and spring-type. Gravity-type accumulators operate based on the force of gravity, where the weight of a piston or bladder creates pressure within the system. On the other hand, spring-type accumulators use a spring mechanism to generate pressure. Both types of accumulators are commonly used in hydraulic systems to store energy and maintain consistent pressure levels. The choice between gravity and spring-type accumulators depends on factors such as system requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>
