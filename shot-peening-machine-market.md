<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shot Peening Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Semi-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shot peening machines come in two main types: automatic and semi-automatic. Automatic shot peening machines require minimal human intervention and are ideal for high-volume production environments. These machines are equipped with automated features that streamline the peening process. On the other hand, semi-automatic machines require some manual input from operators, making them suitable for smaller-scale operations or applications that require more control over the peening process. Both types of machines are designed to enhance the strength and durability of metal components through controlled shot blasting.</p></p>
