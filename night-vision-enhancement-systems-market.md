<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Night Vision Enhancement Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Near-infrared (NIR)</li><li>Far-infrared (FIR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Night Vision Enhancement Systems are used in various industries such as military, law enforcement, and automotive. Two main types of night vision systems are Near-infrared (NIR) and Far-infrared (FIR). NIR systems use wavelengths just beyond the visible spectrum to provide enhanced vision in low-light conditions. FIR systems, on the other hand, use longer wavelengths to detect heat emitted by objects, making them suitable for detecting objects in complete darkness. Both types of systems have their own unique applications and advantages in different scenarios.</p></p>
