<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borosilicate Glass Wafer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Polished</li><li>Two Side Polished</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Borosilicate glass wafers come in two main types: single side polished and two side polished. Single side polished wafers have one side that is precisely polished to provide a flat, smooth surface for deposition processes. Two side polished wafers have both sides polished to ensure uniformity in thickness and smoothness. Single side polished wafers are typically used in applications where only one side needs to be processed, while two side polished wafers are preferred for applications requiring high precision and consistency on both sides.</p></p>
