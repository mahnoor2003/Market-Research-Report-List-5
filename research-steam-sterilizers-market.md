<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Research Steam Sterilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Cycle</li><li>SFPP Cycle</li><li>Pre-Vac Cycle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Research Steam Sterilizers Market includes three main types: Gravity Cycle, SFPP Cycle, and Pre-Vac Cycle. Gravity Cycle sterilizers rely on gravity to remove air from the chamber before steam is introduced. SFPP Cycle sterilizers combine the advantages of both gravity and pre-vacuum cycles, removing air through a series of pressure and vacuum pulses. Pre-Vac Cycle sterilizers use a pre-vacuum phase to remove air before steam sterilization. Each type has its unique advantages and is suitable for different applications in healthcare facilities and laboratories.</p></p>
