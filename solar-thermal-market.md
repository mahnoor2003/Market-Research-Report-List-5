<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Solar Thermal</li><li>Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) technology involves the use of mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a smaller area, producing high temperatures that are used to generate electricity or heat. This technology is typically used in large-scale utility projects. On the other hand, Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal (NCST) technology captures sunlight directly without the need for concentration, using it to generate heat or electricity in a more distributed manner, often in residential or commercial applications. Both CST and NCST play important roles in the solar thermal market, catering to different scales and needs.</p></p>
