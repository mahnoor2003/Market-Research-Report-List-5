<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diverter Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AutoDiverterValves</li><li>ManualDiverterValves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diverter valves are commonly classified into two main types: Auto Diverter Valves and Manual Diverter Valves. Auto diverter valves are equipped with sensors or actuators that automatically redirect flow based on preset conditions or inputs. On the other hand, manual diverter valves require operators to physically adjust the valve to redirect flow. Both types serve the purpose of regulating flow direction in various industrial processes, with auto diverter valves offering more automation and precision while manual diverter valves provide more control and flexibility.</p></p>
