<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Solenoid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Universal Direct Acting</li><li>Semi-Direct Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Universal Direct Acting Vacuum Solenoid Valves consist of a simple design where the solenoid directly opens and closes the valve without any additional mechanism. These valves are commonly used in applications where fast response times are needed. Semi-Direct Acting Vacuum Solenoid Valves have a combination of direct and pilot operations, allowing them to handle higher pressures and flow rates than universal direct acting valves. They are often used in more demanding industrial applications that require precise control and reliability.</p></p>
