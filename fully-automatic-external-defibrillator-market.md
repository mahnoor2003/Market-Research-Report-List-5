<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automatic External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-synchronous Defibrillator</li><li>Synchronous Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Non-synchronous defibrillator does not analyze the heart rhythm before delivering a shock, making it suitable for quickly treating a patient in cardiac arrest. On the other hand, a Synchronous defibrillator monitors the heart rhythm and only delivers a shock if necessary, making it more precise in identifying and treating specific types of arrhythmias. Both types of defibrillators play a crucial role in saving lives during cardiac emergencies, but they are designed to cater to different needs and situations.</p></p>
