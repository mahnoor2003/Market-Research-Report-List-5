<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof-mounted</li><li>Floor-mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central inverters are commonly used in solar power generation systems. They come in two main types: roof-mounted and floor-mounted. Roof-mounted inverters are installed on the roof of a building, making use of the available space and reducing installation costs. On the other hand, floor-mounted inverters are installed on the ground and are suitable for larger installations where space is not a constraint. Both types of inverters play a crucial role in converting DC power from solar panels into AC power for use in homes and businesses.</p></p>
