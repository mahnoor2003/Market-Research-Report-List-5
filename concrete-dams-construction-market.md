<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Dams Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Concrete Dam</li><li>Roller Compacted Concrete Dam</li><li>Prefabricated Concrete Dam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Normal concrete dams are the traditional type of concrete dams constructed with conventional concrete pouring methods. Roller compacted concrete dams use a drier mix of concrete that is compacted using rollers to form a dam structure. Prefabricated concrete dams are built off-site and transported to the construction site for assembly. Each type of concrete dam construction method has its own advantages and applications depending on factors such as cost, time, and site constraints.</p></p>
