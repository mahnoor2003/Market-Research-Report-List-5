<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Wall Hung Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas wall hung boilers are divided into two main market types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing boilers are more energy-efficient as they capture and reuse heat that would otherwise be lost in the flue gases. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, release this heat into the atmosphere. Condensing boilers have a higher upfront cost but can result in long-term savings on energy bills. Non-condensing boilers are typically lower in cost but are less energy-efficient overall.</p></p>
