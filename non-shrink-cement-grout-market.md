<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-shrink Cement Grout Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-packed</li><li>Fluid Packaged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-shrink cement grout is available in two main types: dry-packed and fluid packaged. Dry-packed grout is a pre-blended mixture of cement, aggregate, and other additives that can be mixed with water on-site to form a thick, stiff consistency for applications such as filling gaps or voids. Fluid packaged grout, on the other hand, is a ready-to-use mixture that is already in a fluid state and typically used for pouring into confined spaces or under machinery. Both types of grout are designed to resist shrinking during the curing process, ensuring a strong and durable bond.</p></p>
