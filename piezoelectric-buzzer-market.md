<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Buzzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Piezo Buzzer</li><li>Passive Piezo Buzze</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoelectric buzzers are classified into two main types: active and passive. Active piezo buzzers require an external oscillator circuit to produce sound, making them suitable for applications where precise control of frequency and duration is needed. Passive piezo buzzers, on the other hand, produce sound directly when a voltage is applied, making them simpler to use but with less control over the sound output. Both types are widely used in various electronic devices for alerting and notification purposes.</p></p>
